# Project Overview
---

The financial services industry operates within a dynamic ecosystem, where customer retention stands as a pivotal factor for long-term growth and brand sustainability. A Canadian bank, grappling with customer churn, approached Datafied Technologies for assistance. The bank's challenges include revenue loss, diminished brand loyalty, and a lack of insights into the factors driving customer attrition. To address these issues, Datafied Technologies was tasked with leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) through Power BI to delve into a churn database containing records of 10,000 bank customers over a six-month period.
